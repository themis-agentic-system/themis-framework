Alleged victim has history of making false accusations (need to investigate). Neighbor's 911 call only reported hearing 'loud argument' but no sounds of physical violence. Client's statements should be suppressed as they were obtained in violation of Miranda during custodial interrogation. Body cam footage will show no visible injuries on alleged victim and will corroborate that argument was only verbal. Client has recordings on his phone of alleged victim threatening him and admitting she would 'call the cops' to get him in trouble.",

It was heated and we were yelling at each other, but I never touched her. I would never hurt her. At some point a neighbor must have called the police because they showed up and knocked on the door. I opened it and they asked what was going on. I tried to explain we were just arguing but they pushed past me into the apartment. They separated us and talked to Jennifer first. Then they put me in handcuffs and started asking me if I hit her or pushed her. I kept saying no, I didn't touch her. They didn't read me my rights. After about 15-20 minutes they arrested me. Jennifer has threatened before to 'call the cops' on me when we fight. I actually have recordings on my phone of her saying she would do this. I never hurt her and there's no evidence I did because it didn't happen. This whole thing is a lie."
