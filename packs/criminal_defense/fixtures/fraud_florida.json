They give me access to their accounts and authorize me to pay bills, make deposits, and manage their finances. The three people claiming I defrauded them were my clients. They signed agreements authorizing me to handle their money. We had disputes over fees and some accounting errors, but I never stole anything. When the detectives arrested me and took me to the station, I was terrified. I told them I wanted a lawyer but they said 'we just need to clear this up, it will be faster if you talk to us now.' They questioned me for what felt like forever. I kept trying to explain that I was authorized to write those checks but they wouldn't listen. Everything I did was authorized and documented. I have contracts and emails proving they gave me permission. This is a business dispute, not a crime."
