Around 10 PM I was walking back through that area and needed to use the bathroom badly. I tried the door at Electronics Plus and it was unlocked, so I went in to use their restroom. On my way in I saw a backpack on the ground outside the door. When I came out of the bathroom, I grabbed the backpack thinking I would turn it in to the store or police. That's when the security guard grabbed me and called the cops. I told the officer I just needed the bathroom and found the backpack outside. I didn't break in - the door was unlocked. I didn't steal anything. The officer read me my rights but I was confused and scared. I didn't really understand what was happening. I never said I broke in or stole anything."
