# Security Improvements and Hardening

**Date:** October 25, 2025
**Status:** Implemented and Tested

## Overview

This document describes security improvements implemented in the Themis Framework to address identified vulnerabilities and enhance production readiness. These improvements focus on protecting against common web application vulnerabilities while maintaining backward compatibility.

---

## Critical Security Fixes

### 1. Timing Attack Protection (CRITICAL)

**Vulnerability:** API key comparison used direct string equality (`==`), which is vulnerable to timing attacks. Attackers could potentially determine API key characters by measuring response times.

**Fix:** Implemented constant-time comparison using `secrets.compare_digest()`.

**Location:** `api/security.py:51`

**Before:**
```python
if api_key != expected_api_key:
    raise HTTPException(...)
```

**After:**
```python
if not secrets.compare_digest(api_key, expected_api_key):
    raise HTTPException(...)
```

**Impact:**
- âœ… Prevents timing-based API key discovery
- âœ… Maintains existing authentication behavior
- âœ… No performance degradation (constant-time is fast)

**CVE Reference:** Similar to CVE-2015-2673 (timing attacks in authentication)

---

### 2. Credential Sanitization in Logs (HIGH)

**Vulnerability:** Authentication headers could potentially be logged in full, exposing API keys in log files.

**Fix:** Sanitize auth headers before logging, extracting only the authentication type (e.g., "Bearer") without the token value.

**Location:** `api/middleware.py:84-86`

**Before:**
```python
auth_header = request.headers.get("authorization", "")
has_auth = bool(auth_header)
# Potential to log auth_header value
```

**After:**
```python
auth_header = request.headers.get("authorization", "")
# Sanitize auth header for logging (only log type, not credentials)
auth_type = auth_header.split()[0] if auth_header else "none"
```

**Impact:**
- âœ… Prevents credential leakage in audit logs
- âœ… Maintains visibility into authentication attempts
- âœ… Complies with OWASP logging best practices

**Logging Output:**
- Before: Could potentially log `Authorization: Bearer secret-key-123`
- After: Logs `auth_type=Bearer` (safe)

---

### 3. Payload Size Limits (HIGH)

**Vulnerability:** No size limits on request payloads, allowing potential DoS attacks via large JSON payloads.

**Fix:** Implemented `PayloadSizeLimitMiddleware` with configurable size limits.

**Location:**
- `api/middleware.py:160-194` (middleware implementation)
- `api/main.py:69` (middleware registration)

**Configuration:**
```python
MAX_REQUEST_SIZE = 10 * 1024 * 1024  # 10MB default
```

**Features:**
- âœ… Checks `Content-Length` header before processing
- âœ… Returns HTTP 413 (Payload Too Large) when exceeded
- âœ… Logs rejected requests for security monitoring
- âœ… Configurable limit per environment

**Impact:**
- âœ… Prevents memory exhaustion attacks
- âœ… Protects against JSON bomb attacks
- âœ… Maintains reasonable limits for legal documents

---

## Enhanced Input Validation

### 4. Pydantic Models for Type Safety (MEDIUM)

**Issue:** Matter payloads used generic `dict[str, Any]` types without validation, allowing malformed data to reach agents.

**Fix:** Implemented comprehensive Pydantic models with validation rules.

**Location:** `orchestrator/models.py`

**Models:**
- `Matter` - Main legal matter with comprehensive validation
- `Document` - Document structure with date validation
- `Event` - Timeline events with date validation
- `Issue` - Legal issues with supporting facts
- `Authority` - Legal citations
- `Goals` - Client objectives
- `Damages` - Damages breakdown with non-negative constraints
- `Metadata` - Matter metadata
- `MatterWrapper` - Wrapper for `{"matter": {...}}` structure

**Validation Rules:**
| Field | Validation | Error Message |
|-------|------------|---------------|
| `summary` | Min 10 characters | "Summary must be at least 10 characters" |
| `parties` | Min 1 item, non-empty | "At least one party must be specified" |
| `documents` | Min 1 item | "At least one document must be provided" |
| `date` fields | ISO 8601 format | "Date must be in YYYY-MM-DD format" |
| `confidence_score` | 0-100 range | "Must be between 0 and 100" |
| `damages.specials` | Non-negative | "Must be >= 0" |

**Integration:**
- Router validation in `orchestrator/router.py:validate_and_extract_matter()`
- Automatic validation on `/plan` and `/execute` endpoints
- Returns HTTP 422 with detailed error messages

**Example Error Response:**
```json
{
  "detail": {
    "message": "Matter validation failed",
    "errors": [
      "summary: String should have at least 10 characters",
      "parties: List should have at least 1 item after validation",
      "documents -> 0 -> date: Date must be in YYYY-MM-DD format, got: 01/15/2024"
    ],
    "total_errors": 3
  }
}
```

**Impact:**
- âœ… Catches malformed data before processing
- âœ… Provides clear error messages to API clients
- âœ… Prevents agent errors due to missing fields
- âœ… Maintains backward compatibility (validation is graceful)

---

## Code Quality Improvements

### 5. Linting and Type Safety (LOW)

**Fix:** Resolved all linting issues identified by Ruff.

**Changes:**
- Removed unused `has_auth` variable in middleware
- Verified no unused imports
- All code passes `ruff check .`

**Impact:**
- âœ… Cleaner codebase
- âœ… Better maintainability
- âœ… Passes CI/CD checks

---

## Testing Coverage

### New Test Suite: `tests/test_security_improvements.py`

**Test Coverage:**
1. âœ… Timing attack protection verification
2. âœ… Auth header sanitization checks
3. âœ… Payload size limit middleware exists
4. âœ… Matter validation with Pydantic (15+ test cases)
5. âœ… Date format validation
6. âœ… Confidence score range validation (0-100)
7. âœ… Damages non-negative constraints
8. âœ… API key verification with valid/invalid keys
9. âœ… Development mode (no auth) testing

**Test Execution:**
```bash
# Run security tests
pytest tests/test_security_improvements.py -v

# Run all tests
pytest tests/ -v
```

## Configuration

### Environment Variables

```bash
# Security Settings
THEMIS_API_KEY=your-secure-api-key-here  # Set to enable authentication
MAX_REQUEST_SIZE=10485760                 # 10MB default

# Rate Limiting (in code, can be made configurable)
# - /plan: 20 requests/minute per IP
# - /execute: 10 requests/minute per IP
# - /plans/{id}: 60 requests/minute per IP
# - /artifacts/{id}: 60 requests/minute per IP
```

### Production Deployment Recommendations

1. **Always set THEMIS_API_KEY** - Never run without authentication in production
2. **Use strong API keys** - At least 32 characters, cryptographically random
3. **Enable HTTPS** - Use TLS 1.3 with valid certificates
4. **Monitor audit logs** - Set up alerts for:
   - Authentication failures (401 responses)
   - Rate limit exceeded (429 responses)
   - Large payload rejections (413 responses)
5. **Regular key rotation** - Rotate API keys quarterly
6. **Network isolation** - Deploy behind firewall/VPC
7. **Least privilege** - Run with minimal OS permissions

## Migration Guide

### For Existing Users

**No action required** - All changes are backward compatible:

1. **Authentication** - Existing API key validation works identically
2. **Matter Validation** - Invalid data now returns helpful 422 errors instead of 500 errors
3. **Payload Limits** - 10MB should accommodate all reasonable legal document sets
4. **Logging** - No changes to log format, just sanitized credentials

### For API Clients

**Matter Validation Errors** - If you receive HTTP 422 errors:

```python
# Check the error response for details
response = requests.post("/orchestrator/plan", json={"matter": {...}})
if response.status_code == 422:
    error_detail = response.json()["detail"]
    print(f"Validation failed: {error_detail['message']}")
    for error in error_detail["errors"]:
        print(f"  - {error}")
```
